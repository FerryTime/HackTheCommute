# HackTheCommute: Ferry Time

The purpose of this app is to help ferry commuters in Washington State.

This application was developed on 2015-03-2[0-2] for the 2015 Seattle [Hack The Commute](http://hackthecommute.seattle.gov).

Our app is live at http://fairytime.herokuapp.com/.

## Challenge and Approach

Our submission is for [Challenge #3: Build an app that provides an example of an Awesome Hackathon submission](http://example.com/this-also-goes-nowhere).

Our approach for satisfying this challenge was to:

- Develop an example Git repository
- Share it on Github
- Collect feedback from the community

Once we did that, we knew we were guaranteed to win!

1.  Our Concept.
    - Commuting via ferry can be troublesome at best
    - Everyone who has used the ferry has the experience of waiting in the queue, not knowing if you'll make it
    - Anyone in the city knows the mess on Fauntleroy and the impact to commuters
    - Many depend on the ferry system to get into Seattle, which has the highest income average in the region
2.  Execution.
    - Awesomeness of Ferry's Fairies, to be seen in action!
3.  The Impact.
    - People have a better travel experience by knowing what to expect
    - From this app, it can build more real time information for WSF, which can inform policy makers 
4.  Implementation & Sustainability.
    - Can depend on advertising to ferry commuters 
      - From feedback, interest seems high
    - Moving forward - need realtime assessment for people "up stream" of the toll booth
      - Utilization of GPS location
      - User inputted landmarks?
      - sensors?
    - Connecting with the Ferry Commnunity
